- **Batch size:** Can handle larger batches for efficient processing
- **Special workaround:** Some users report needing specific PyTorch builds for RTX 5090 compatibility

## Essential Resources and Models

### **ControlNet Union Model (Recommended)**
- **Download:** https://huggingface.co/xinsir/controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0
- **Benefits:** Replaces ALL individual ControlNet models with one unified model
- **Size:** ~2.5GB (Promax version includes inpainting)

### **Required Custom Nodes**
1. ComfyUI Manager (essential)
2. ComfyUI Impact Pack
3. Ultimate SD Upscale
4. ControlNet Auxiliary Preprocessors
5. ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts
6. WAS Node Suite

## Quick Start Recommendations

**For beginners:** Start with **Lucifael All-in-One Workflow** - color-coded design with comprehensive tutorial
